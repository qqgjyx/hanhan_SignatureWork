Agencies issue reminder to institutions on lending when the National Flood Insurance Program is unavailable

Farm Credit Administration

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

Federal Reserve Board

National Credit Union Administration

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

For release at 10:00 a.m. EDT

Federal financial institution regulatory agencies today remind lenders that they may continue to make loans that are subject to the federal flood insurance statutes when the National Flood Insurance Program is not available. During this period, lenders are allowed to make these loans without requiring federal flood insurance.

As explained in the

Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Flood Insurance

, in Q&A Applicability 12, lenders may continue to make loans without flood insurance coverage during this time but must continue to make flood determinations; provide timely, complete, and accurate notices to borrowers; and comply with other applicable parts of the flood insurance regulations. In addition, lenders should evaluate safety and soundness and legal risks and should prudently manage those risks during the lapse period. The guidance also addresses the availability and use of private flood insurance.

Federal Reserve Board modifies Morgan Stanley's stress capital buffer requirement, after the firm requested reconsideration

For release at 4:30 p.m. EDT

The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday modified Morgan Stanley's stress capital buffer requirement, after the firm requested reconsideration. As a result, the bank's requirement for this year is 4.3 percent, down from a preliminary 5.1 percent.

The Board's stress test process allows banks to request reconsideration of their stress capital buffer requirement, which is the capital requirement stemming from the stress test. A bank is required to submit a detailed explanation of why reconsideration should be granted, and the Board then conducts an independent assessment of the request.

Based on an analysis of information presented by Morgan Stanley, the Board determined that estimated losses in the bank's fair value option loan portfolio were too conservative. This was due, in part, to the unique composition of the bank's loan portfolio. In addition, the Board determined to use the bank's second largest counterparty when measuring counterparty losses associated with default of the largest counterparty, as doing so would be more consistent with the Board's treatment of similar counterparties.

The Board will also consider any potential stress test model refinements related to this request in its upcoming proposal to improve the transparency of the stress test.

Federal Reserve Board announces final individual capital requirements for large banks, effective on October 1

For release at 4:00 p.m. EDT

Following its stress test earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced final individual capital requirements for large banks, effective on October 1. Large bank capital requirements are informed by the Board's stress test results, which provide a risk-sensitive and forward-looking assessment of capital needs.

In April, the Board proposed a rule to average stress test results over two consecutive years to reduce year-over-year volatility from the stress test when calculating a firm's capital requirement. If the Board finalizes the rule as proposed, this year's stress test results will be averaged with those from 2024, and updated capital requirements will be published separately.

""As the Board continues to fulfill its commitment to reducing year-over-year volatility and increasing transparency of the stress test, the individual capital requirements announced today represent a period of transition,"" Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle W. Bowman said. ""Finalizing the rule proposed in April would be an important next step to reducing year-over-year volatility in bank capital requirements. This would allow the Board to publish revised stress capital buffer requirements once the rule is finalized, based on averaged stress test results.""

The table in the attached document shows each bank's common equity tier 1 capital requirement, which is made up of several components, including:

The minimum capital requirement, which is the same for each bank and is 4.5 percent;

The stress capital buffer requirement, which is based in part on the stress test results and is at least 2.5 percent; and

If applicable, a capital surcharge for the largest and most complex banks, which is updated in the first quarter of each year to account for the overall systemic risk of each of these banks.

If a bank's capital dips below its total requirement announced today, the bank is subject to automatic restrictions on both capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.

The individual capital requirements published today do not include a stress capital buffer requirement for Morgan Stanley, as the firm requested reconsideration to reduce this requirement. The Board is reviewing the request to reduce the firm's stress capital buffer requirement and expects to make its decision and publish, by September 30, 2025, Morgan Stanley's final individual capital requirement.

For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT

The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) today released the public sections of resolution plans for the eight largest and most complex domestic banking organizations and 56 foreign banking organizations. These banks were required to submit resolution plans by July 1, 2025.

Resolution plans, commonly known as living wills, are required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. These plans describe a banking organization's strategy for orderly resolution under bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure. By regulation, resolution plans must be divided into public and confidential sections. To foster transparency, the agencies have required each banking organization's public section to summarize certain elements of the resolution plan.

In addition, the FDIC released public sections of the separate resolution plans of 12 large insured depository institutions (IDIs), which are required under the FDIC's IDI Rule. These IDI resolution plans, which were also required to be submitted by July 1, 2025, are designed to enable the FDIC to efficiently resolve an IDI under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act in the event of its failure.

The public sections of the resolution plans are available on the FDIC's and the

Board's

websites.

Adriana D. Kugler submits resignation as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, effective August 8, 2025

For release at 3:30 p.m. EDT

The Federal Reserve Board announced on Friday that Adriana D. Kugler will step down from her position as governor of the Federal Reserve Board, effective August 8, 2025.

Dr. Kugler, who has served as a governor since September 13, 2023, submitted her letter of resignation to President Trump and will return to Georgetown University as a professor this fall. The text of the letter from Governor Kugler is attached.

""It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,"" said Governor Kugler. ""I am especially honored to have served during a critical time in achieving our dual mandate of bringing down prices and keeping a strong and resilient labor market.""

""I appreciate Dr. Kugler's service on the Board and wish her very well in her future endeavors,"" said Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell. ""She brought impressive experience and academic insights to her work on the Board.""

As a governor, Dr. Kugler was an active member in multiple committees including the Committee on Financial Stability, the Committee on Federal Reserve Bank Affairs, the Committee on Board Affairs, and the Subcommittee on Smaller Regional and Community Banking.

Federal Reserve Board joins other federal financial institution regulatory agencies in providing banks the flexibility to use an alternative method for collecting certain customer identification information

For release at 2:30 p.m. EDT

The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday joined other federal financial institution regulatory agencies, as well as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, in providing banks the flexibility to use an alternative method for collecting certain customer identification information. Specifically, the agencies now permit banks and credit unions to obtain a tax identification number from a third party, rather than directly from the customer.

By law, banks and credit unions are required to verify the identity of a potential customer by obtaining certain identifying information before opening an account. Since this requirement's implementation in 2003, there have been considerable changes in the way that customers interact with banks and receive financial services. Today's action will grant banks flexibility in how they obtain this information, while ensuring that risk-based procedures continue to underpin verification of a customer's identity.

The flexibility from this action is optional, and banks are not required to use alternative collection methods. The Board coordinated its action with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Administration, and the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.

For release at 4:00 p.m. EDT

The federal bank regulatory agencies today announced their fourth notice requesting public comment to reduce regulatory burden. The Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act requires the agencies to review their regulations at least once every 10 years to identify outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome regulatory requirements for their supervised institutions.

To facilitate this review, the agencies divided their regulations into 12 categories and are now soliciting comments on their regulations for the three remaining categories: Banking Operations, Capital, and the Community Reinvestment Act. The public has 90 days from publication in the

Federal Register

to comment on the relevant regulations.

The agencies will hold outreach meetings where interested parties may comment on applicable regulatory requirements directly to the agencies. Information about the outreach meetings will be publicized as details are finalized.

Federal bank regulatory agencies today jointly issued a proposal to rescind the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) final rule issued in October 2023 and replace it with the prior CRA regulations that were originally adopted by the agencies in 1995, with certain technical amendments. If adopted, the proposal would restore certainty in the CRA framework for stakeholders in light of pending litigation and limit regulatory burden on banks, while ensuring that banks continue to serve their communities.

Because the 2023 final rule is subject to legal action and has not taken effect, the agencies continue to apply the 1995 regulations to banks today.

Federal bank regulatory agencies today issued a joint statement in their continued efforts to provide clarity on banks' engagement in crypto-asset-related activities. The statement highlights for banks potential risk-management considerations related to holding crypto-assets on their customers' behalf, or crypto-asset safekeeping.

The joint statement discusses existing risk-management principles that apply to crypto-asset safekeeping and reminds banks that provide or are considering providing safekeeping of such assets that they must do so in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

The statement does not create any new supervisory expectations. The agencies continue to explore ways to provide additional clarity with respect to banks' engagement in crypto-asset-related activities.

Federal Reserve Board requests comment on targeted proposal to revise its supervisory rating framework for large bank holding companies to address the ""well managed"" status of these firms

For release at 2:15 p.m. EDT

The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday requested comment on a targeted proposal to revise its supervisory rating framework for large bank holding companies to address the ""well managed"" status of these firms. The revisions would better align the supervisory rating framework with and more accurately reflect the strength of bank holding companies and the banking system as a whole. The proposal would also better align the framework with the supervisory rating systems used for other banking organizations.

The Board's large bank supervisory rating framework, issued in 2018, evaluates whether these banks have sufficient financial and operational strength and resilience to maintain safe-and-sound operations and comply with laws and regulations through a range of conditions. The framework includes three components: capital, liquidity, and governance and controls. Each component has four potential ratings: broadly meets expectations, conditionally meets expectations, deficient-1, or deficient-2.

The proposal would amend the framework by considering a bank with no more than one ""deficient-1"" rating to be ""well managed."" Firms that do not meet this standard would be deemed not well managed and would face limitations on certain activities. Consistent with the current framework, a bank with a deficient-2 rating for any component would continue to be considered not well managed.

The Board is also proposing to make similar changes to its supervisory rating framework for insurers regulated by the Board.

The Board will evaluate additional comprehensive changes, including options to consider adding composite ratings to both frameworks, as well as changes to other supervisory rating systems.

Comments on today's proposal are due 30 days after publication in the

Federal Reserve Board's annual bank stress test showed that large banks are well positioned to weather a severe recession, while staying above minimum capital requirements and continuing to lend to households and businesses

For release at 4:30 p.m. EDT

The results of the Federal Reserve Board's annual bank stress test showed that large banks are well positioned to weather a severe recession, while staying above minimum capital requirements and continuing to lend to households and businesses.

Under this year's hypothetical recession, the aggregate decline in the common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, which provides a cushion against losses, is 1.8 percentage points. In April, the Board proposed a rule to average stress test results over two consecutive years to reduce volatility from the stress test when calculating a firm's capital requirement. If the Board finalizes the rule as proposed, this year's results would be averaged with the 2024 results, which would lead to an aggregate capital decline of 2.3 percentage points.

The decrease in this year's test is smaller than the aggregate decline observed in recent years and, in part, reflects unintended volatility in the models used for the stress tests. The Board intends to address this issue when it discloses and seeks public comment on models and its scenario design framework later this year.

""Large banks remain well capitalized and resilient to a range of severe outcomes,"" Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle W. Bowman said. ""One way to address the excessive volatility in the stress test results and corresponding capital requirements is for the Board to finalize the proposal that would average two consecutive years of stress test results, which was released in April.""

All 22 banks tested remained above their minimum CET1 capital requirements during the stress scenario, after absorbing total projected hypothetical losses of more than $550 billion.

This year's stress scenario is less severe than last year's scenario due to the stress test's countercyclical design. It includes a severe global recession with a 30 percent decline in commercial real estate prices and a 33 percent decline in house prices. The unemployment rate rises nearly 5.9 percentage points to a peak of 10 percent, and economic output declines commensurately.

There are three main factors that influence the results of this year's test:

Lower loan losses in a less severe scenario, due to the mild slowing of the U.S. economy in 2024 and the countercyclical nature of the Board's scenario design;

Lower private equity losses due to the Board adjusting how these exposures are measured to better align with these exposures' characteristics; and

Higher net revenue due to the effect of improved bank performance and atypical trading positions as viewed through the lens of the supervisory stress test framework.

Total projected losses of more than $550 billion include nearly $158 billion in credit card losses, $124 billion in losses from commercial and industrial loans, and $52 billion in losses from commercial real estate.

Also on Friday, the Board released corrected 2024 stress test results and capital requirements stemming from modest errors in the loss projections for corporate and first-lien mortgage loans. These corrections did not change the aggregate post-stress capital decline in 2024.

Agencies request comment on proposal to modify certain regulatory capital standards

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

For release at 11:00 a.m. EDT

The federal bank regulatory agencies today requested comment on a proposal to modify certain regulatory capital standards to reduce disincentives for banking organizations to engage in lower-risk activities and promote the smooth functioning of U.S. Treasury markets.

Banking organizations are subject to both risk-based and leverage capital requirements. Risk-based capital requirements vary based on the risks of individual exposures, imposing lower capital requirements, for example, on a Treasury security with lower risk than on a corporate bond with higher risk. Leverage capital requirements, by design, treat all exposures equally. A leverage capital requirement that is generally higher than risk-based capital requirements can discourage banking organizations from engaging in low-risk activities, such as U.S. Treasury market intermediation.

The proposal would modify certain leverage capital standards applicable to the largest and most systemically important banking organizations so that they serve as a backstop to risk-based capital requirements and do not discourage these banking organizations from engaging in low-risk activities. In particular, the proposal would set the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio for both bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries so that it is based on a banking organization's overall systemic risk.

The agencies anticipate that the amount of overall capital that banking organizations maintain would generally stay the same as a result of this proposal. In aggregate, the proposal would reduce tier 1 capital standards for affected bank holding companies by less than two percent. Although certain depository institution subsidiaries could see greater reductions, that capital generally would not be available for distribution to external shareholders given the restrictions that apply at the bank holding company level.

The proposal would also make conforming changes to other regulations that are tied to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, such as total loss-absorbing capacity and long-term debt requirements.

Comments on the proposal are due by August 26, 2025.

For release at 4:00 p.m. EDT

Federal bank regulatory agencies today released the 2025 list of distressed or underserved nonmetropolitan middle-income geographies where certain bank activities are eligible for Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) credit.

Under the CRA, the agencies assess a bank's record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. The list released by the agencies includes distressed or underserved nonmetropolitan middle-income geographies where revitalization or stabilization activities are eligible to receive CRA consideration. The designations reflect local economic conditions, including unemployment, poverty, and population changes. Previous years' lists and criteria for designating these areas are available

here

.

Revitalization or stabilization activities in these geographies are eligible to receive CRA consideration under the community development definition for 12 months after publication of the current list. As with past lists, the agencies apply a one-year lag period for geographies that were included in 2024 but are no longer designated as distressed or underserved in the current list.

The agencies leveraged an updated methodology to designate underserved middle-income census tracts for this list, based upon revised source information from various agencies. As a result, the amended urban influence codes use similar criteria and methods as previous delineations but have been consolidated from 12 to 9 categories. Additional information is available in the Source Information and Methodology.

Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress

Chair Jerome H. Powell

Before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives

Watch Live

Chair Powell submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on June 25, 2025.

Chairman Hill, Ranking Member Waters, and other members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual

Monetary Policy Report

.

The Federal Reserve remains squarely focused on achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. Despite elevated uncertainty, the economy is in a solid position. The unemployment rate remains low, and the labor market is at or near maximum employment. Inflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-run objective. We are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate.

I will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.

Current Economic Situation and Outlook

Incoming data suggest that the economy remains solid. Following growth of 2.5 percent last year, gross domestic product (GDP) was reported to have edged down in the first quarter, reflecting swings in net exports that were driven by businesses bringing in imports ahead of potential tariffs. This unusual swing has complicated GDP measurement. Private domestic final purchases (PDFP)—which excludes net exports, inventory investment, and government spending—grew at a solid 2.5 percent rate. Within PDFP, growth of consumer spending moderated, while investment in equipment and intangibles rebounded from weakness in the fourth quarter. Surveys of households and businesses, however, report a decline in sentiment over recent months and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook, largely reflecting trade policy concerns. It remains to be seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment.

In the labor market, conditions have remained solid. Payroll job gains averaged a moderate 124,000 per month in the first five months of the year. The unemployment rate, at 4.2 percent in May, remains low and has stayed in a narrow range for the past year. Wage growth has continued to moderate while still outpacing inflation. Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are broadly in balance and consistent with maximum employment. The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures. The strong labor market conditions in recent years have helped narrow long-standing disparities in employment and earnings across demographic groups.

Inflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in May and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.6 percent. Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up over recent months, as reflected in both market- and survey-based measures. Respondents to surveys of consumers, businesses, and professional forecasters point to tariffs as the driving factor. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.

Monetary Policy

Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. With the labor market at or near maximum employment and inflation remaining somewhat elevated, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent since the beginning of the year. We have also continued to reduce our holdings of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities and, beginning in April, further slowed the pace of this decline to facilitate a smooth transition to ample reserve balances. We will continue to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.

Policy changes continue to evolve, and their effects on the economy remain uncertain. The effects of tariffs will depend, among other things, on their ultimate level. Expectations of that level, and thus of the related economic effects, reached a peak in April and have since declined. Even so, increases in tariffs this year are likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity.

The effects on inflation could be short lived—reflecting a one-time shift in the price level. It is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent. Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the tariff effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully into prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.

The FOMC's obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent a one-time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem. As we act to meet that obligation, we will balance our maximum-employment and price-stability mandates, keeping in mind that, without price stability, we cannot achieve the long periods of strong labor market conditions that benefit all Americans.

For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.

To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.

Thank you. I am happy to take your questions.

Federal Reserve Board announces that reputational risk will no longer be a component of examination programs in its supervision of banks

For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT

The Federal Reserve Board on Monday announced that reputational risk will no longer be a component of examination programs in its supervision of banks.

The Board has started the process of reviewing and removing references to reputation and reputational risk from its supervisory materials, including examination manuals, and, where appropriate, replacing those references with more specific discussions of financial risk. The Board will train examiners to help ensure this change is implemented consistently across Board-supervised banks and will work with the other federal bank regulatory agencies to promote consistent practices, as necessary.

This change does not alter the Board's expectation that banks maintain strong risk management to ensure safety and soundness and compliance with law and regulation nor is it intended to impact whether and how Board-supervised banks use the concept of reputational risk in their own risk management practices.

Federal bank regulatory agencies seek comment to address payments and check fraud

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

Federal Reserve Board

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

For release at 5:00 p.m. EDT

The federal bank regulatory agencies today announced a request for comment on potential actions to help consumers, businesses, and financial institutions mitigate risk of payments fraud, with a particular focus on check fraud. For purposes of the request for information, payments fraud generally refers to the use of illegal means to make or receive payments for personal gain, including scams.

Because payments fraud may involve multiple institutions and payment methods, no single agency or private-sector entity can address payments fraud on its own. Therefore, the agencies are seeking public comment on discrete actions, collectively or independently, to mitigate payments fraud, including check fraud, within their respective bank regulation and payments authorities.

Input is requested on five potential areas for improvement and collaboration:

External collaboration among the agencies, Federal Reserve Banks, and industry stakeholders;

Consumer, business, and industry education by the agencies and Federal Reserve Banks to educate about payments fraud;

Regulation and supervision to mitigate payments fraud, including opportunities the Board may have related to check fraud;

Payments fraud data collection and information sharing; and

Federal Reserve Banks' operator tools and services to reduce payments fraud.

In addition to seeking public input, the agencies will also continue looking for additional opportunities to effectively collaborate across other state and federal agencies given the importance of interagency coordination to help mitigate payments fraud.

Comments must be received within 90 days after date of publication in the

Federal Reserve Board announces that results from its annual bank stress test will be released on Friday, June 27, at 4:30 p.m. EDT

The Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced that results from its annual bank stress test will be released on Friday, June 27, at 4:30 p.m. EDT. Additionally, today the Board published its annual stress test methodology document, which provides details about the models used in the stress test.

The Board's stress test is one tool used to measure whether banks have adequate capital to absorb losses so that they can lend to households and businesses even in a severe recession. It evaluates banks' resilience by estimating losses, net revenue, and capital levels—which provide a cushion against losses—under a hypothetical recession scenario.

This year, 22 large banks were subject to the Board's stress test. The scenario includes a severe global recession with heightened stress in both commercial and residential real estate markets, as well as in corporate debt markets.

Michael E. Horowitz appointed Inspector General for the Federal Reserve Board and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

For release at 2:30 p.m. EDT

Michael E. Horowitz has been appointed to lead the Federal Reserve Board's Office of Inspector General (OIG) effective June 30, 2025. By statute, the Federal Reserve's OIG also serves in that same role for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an agency financed by, but autonomous from, the Federal Reserve. The OIG is tasked with making recommendations to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the agencies, as well as preventing and detecting waste, fraud, and abuse.

Horowitz succeeds Mark Bialek, who retired in April, after nearly 14 years as inspector general. Horowitz has more than 35 years of experience in law, public administration, and investigations. He most recently served as inspector general for the Department of Justice, a position he has held since April 2012. Horowitz also chaired a committee of 21 federal inspectors general to oversee $5 trillion in pandemic relief spending, has chaired the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, and has been a member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Earlier in his career, he served as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, eventually serving as chief of that office's public corruption unit. He holds a J.D. from Harvard Law School and a B.A. from Brandeis University.

The Office of Inspector General was established by the Congress as an independent oversight authority for the Board and the CFPB and carries out its operations pursuant to the Inspector General Act of 1978.

Federal Reserve Board begins 2025 Census of Finance Companies and Other Lenders

For release at 12:00 p.m. EDT

The Federal Reserve Board announced on Friday that it began its 2025 Census of Finance Companies and Other Lenders. This regular census is a key part of the Federal Reserve's effort to produce data on the types and volumes of financing provided by nonbank financial institutions to households and businesses in the U.S. economy.

The assets and liabilities of finance companies have been surveyed by the Federal Reserve at roughly five-year intervals since 1955. The collected data provide a benchmark for a

monthly report on the outstanding accounts receivable of finance companies

and provide a comprehensive update on these companies' sources of funds. This information in turn becomes an important input for the

Federal Reserve's estimates of total consumer credit

and the

Financial Accounts of the United States

, which is an integrated set of sector-level balance sheets that tracks financial flows across sectors of the economy.

The attached letter from Chair Jerome H. Powell was sent to approximately 13,000 companies encouraging participation in the census. Individual responses will be kept confidential. More information about the census is available at

Federal Reserve announces Wells Fargo is no longer subject to the asset growth restriction from the Board’s 2018 enforcement action against the bank

For release at 4:00 p.m. EDT

The Federal Reserve on Tuesday announced that Wells Fargo is no longer subject to the asset growth restriction from the

Board's 2018 enforcement action

against the bank. The Federal Reserve determined that Wells Fargo has met all the conditions required by the 2018 enforcement action for removal of the growth restriction.

Under the 2018 enforcement action, the bank was required to improve its governance and risk management program, and complete a third-party review of these improvements, for the growth restriction to be removed.

The Federal Reserve has completed its review of the bank's remediation efforts and required third-party assessments, and has completed its own assessment of Wells Fargo's corporate governance and firmwide risk management programs. The removal of the growth restriction reflects the substantial progress the bank has made in addressing its deficiencies and that the bank has fulfilled the conditions required for removal of the growth restriction. The other provisions in the 2018 enforcement action will remain in place until the bank satisfies the requirements for their termination.

The most recent survey was conducted in collaboration with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York between March 21 2025, and March 31, 2025, and includes responses from banks that held around three-fourths of total banking system reserve balances at the time of the survey.

The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday issued its

Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2024

report, which examines the financial circumstances of U.S. adults and their families. Overall, the report shows that financial well-being was similar to the previous two years as concerns about prices persisted and labor market conditions remained solid.

The report draws from the Board's annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED), which was fielded in October 2024. It analyzes a wide variety of topics including financial well-being, handling expenses, employment, and gig work.

This year's report finds that 73 percent of adults reported either doing okay or living comfortably financially, similar to recent years but lower than a high of 78 percent in 2021. The share who would cover a $400 emergency expense using cash or its equivalent was also nearly unchanged from recent years at 63 percent.

Inflation and prices continued to be the top financial concern. A majority of adults said that changes in the prices they paid over the prior year had made their finances worse, but the share saying so declined from 2023. In response to higher prices, most people reported taking actions such as adjusting their spending.

Responses indicated that the labor market remained solid. Similar shares of people started new jobs in 2024 compared with 2023. Additionally, the shares of people who were laid off or voluntarily left a job were each unchanged from the prior year. Yet, the survey also found that job changes were less likely to lead to better jobs. In 2024, 62 percent of people who had a different job than a year earlier said that their new job was better overall, which was down from a peak of 72 percent in 2022 and 67 percent in 2023. When asked about specific job characteristics, job changers were less likely to say that pay and benefits, opportunities for advancement, interest in the work, and work-life balance were better in their new job.

""The financial well-being of American households and businesses is essential to our nation's overall economic vitality,"" said Federal Reserve Board Governor Michael S. Barr. ""It is critical for the Federal Reserve to understand the challenges households and businesses face as we work to promote a healthy economy and strong financial system.""

Survey results also highlighted the risk of financial fraud facing consumers. Twenty-one percent of adults experienced financial fraud in 2024, with credit card fraud as the most common type. The 8 percent of adults who experienced fraud not related to their credit card incurred an estimated $63 billion in total unrecovered losses.

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT

Federal bank regulatory agencies today jointly issued updated host state loan-to-deposit ratios,

as required by law

. Each respective host state loan-to-deposit ratio shows the ratio of total loans in a state to total deposits in the state for all banks that have that state as their home state. These ratios replace those issued in May 2024.

By law, a bank is generally prohibited from establishing or acquiring branches outside of its home state primarily for the purpose of acquiring additional deposits. This prohibition seeks to ensure that interstate bank branches will not take deposits from a community without the bank also reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of that community.

The updated ratios, including additional information on how they are used to evaluate compliance with the requirements, are available

The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced the withdrawal of guidance for banks related to their crypto-asset and dollar token activities and related changes to its expectations for these activities. These actions ensure the Board's expectations remain aligned with evolving risks and further support innovation in the banking system.

The Board is rescinding its 2022

supervisory letter

establishing an expectation that state member banks provide advance notification of planned or current crypto-asset activities. As a result, the Board will no longer expect banks to provide notification and will instead monitor banks' crypto-asset activities through the normal supervisory process.

The Board is also rescinding its 2023

supervisory letter

regarding the supervisory nonobjection process for state member bank engagement in dollar token activities.

Finally, the Board, together with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is joining the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in withdrawing from two 2023 statements jointly issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies regarding banks' crypto-asset activities and exposures. The Board will work with the agencies to consider whether additional guidance to support innovation, including crypto-asset activities, is appropriate.

The Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced its approval of the application by Capital One Financial Corporation, of McLean, Virginia, to merge with Discover Financial Services, of Riverwoods, Illinois, and thereby indirectly acquire Discover Bank, of Greenwood, Delaware.

The Board evaluated the application under the statutory factors it is required to consider, including the financial and managerial resources of the companies, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served by the combined organization, and the competitive and financial stability impacts of the proposal.

The Board also entered into a consent order with Discover and assessed a fine of $100 million for overcharging certain interchange fees from 2007 through 2023. Discover has since terminated these practices and is repaying those fees to affected customers. The Board's action is being taken in coordination with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. As a condition of the Board's approval of the merger application, Capital One has committed that it will comply with the Board's action against Discover, including remediation requirements.

Federal Reserve Board requests comment on a proposal to reduce the volatility of the capital requirements stemming from the Board's annual stress test results

For release at 5:30 p.m. EDT

The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday requested comment on a proposal to reduce the volatility of the capital requirements stemming from the Board's annual stress test results. The proposal is the first of several actions following the Board's

announcement in December

committing to broad stress test changes.

In recent years, the framework of administrative law has changed significantly. As previously announced, the Board analyzed the current stress test in view of those changes and determined the test should be modified in important respects to improve its resiliency.

The Board's stress test evaluates the resilience of large banks by estimating their losses, revenue, and capital levels under a hypothetical severe recession scenario. Due to the changing hypothetical nature of the test, the results also change and introduce volatility each year. The results, in part, determine the calibration of the stress capital buffer (SCB), which is one component of the amount of capital large banks must hold to absorb losses.

Today's proposal would address two of these areas, first by averaging stress test results over two consecutive years to reduce the year-over-year changes in the capital requirements that result from the stress test. In addition, the proposal would delay the annual effective date of the stress capital buffer requirement from October 1 to January 1 of the following year, giving banks additional time to adjust to their new capital requirements. Lastly, the proposal would make targeted changes to streamline the Board's stress test-related data collection. These proposed changes are not designed to materially affect overall capital requirements.

Later this year, the Board intends to propose additional changes to improve the transparency of the stress test. Those changes include disclosing and seeking public comment on the models that determine the hypothetical losses and revenue of banks under stress, and ensuring that the public can comment on the hypothetical scenarios used for the annual stress test before the scenarios are finalized.

Comments on today's proposal are due 60 days after publication in the

Federal Register

Agencies take action on appraisal requirements in an area affected by California wildfires and straight-line winds

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

For release at 1:00 p.m. EDT

To help facilitate recovery efforts from wildfires and straight-line wind damage in Los Angeles County, California this year, four federal financial institution regulatory agencies today temporarily paused certain appraisal requirements for real estate-related transactions.

This action is expected to allow banks and credit unions to work with families and businesses without obtaining an appraisal. Banks and credit unions will still be required to determine that the value of the real estate supports the institution's decision to enter into the transaction.

As a result of this action, financial institutions will be better able to lend or modify loans in areas where wildfire and straight-line wind damage has made appraisals challenging to obtain. This action is also expected to reduce loan processing times, helping to facilitate recovery from the disaster.

This action will expire on January 8, 2028. The agencies will monitor institutions' real estate lending practices to ensure the transactions are being conducted in a safe and sound manner.

Nomination hearing

Governor Michelle W. Bowman

Before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate

Watch Live

Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Warren, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. I am deeply honored and grateful for the trust and confidence President Trump has placed in me by nominating me to fill the role of Vice Chair for Supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

I am also grateful to my family for their continued support. My husband, Wes, and our two children, Jack and Audrey, are here with me today. The rest of our family are watching from home in Kansas.

My background as a community banker, as the Kansas State Bank Commissioner, and more than six years of experience as a member of the Board and the FOMC has thoroughly prepared me to carry out the responsibilities of the Vice Chair for Supervision. During my tenure, I have served as oversight governor for the Division of Consumer and Community Affairs, chair of the Smaller Regional and Community Banking subcommittee, member of the Payments committee and currently as Chair of the Committee on Supervision and Regulation. In all of my roles, I have worked to ensure the safety and soundness, and fairness, of the financial system to support a strong economy.

If confirmed, I will prioritize reforming and refocusing supervision, restoring regulatory tailoring, ensuring a viable path for innovation in the banking system, and promoting transparency and accountability.

First, supervision must be reformed and refocused to better address core and material financial risks. We have seen significant shortcomings in supervision over the past few years that must be addressed to ensure that the U.S. banking system is safe and sound. Supervision must be grounded in applicable law, and provide clear standards to regulated institutions. Supervisory expectations should not surprise regulated firms. Supervision cannot eliminate risk from the banking system, but it can and should promote sensible risk management that enables the banking system to support economic growth and serve the financial needs of all Americans. And should a bank fail, supervision should minimize and mitigate any harm to consumers, businesses, and the financial system.

Second, regulations must be approached in a pragmatic way that ensures they are efficient and effective. This pragmatic approach requires identifying the problem targeted by the regulation, considering the costs and benefits of any proposed change, as well as incentive effects, impacts on markets, and potential unintended consequences. We must prioritize the identification and remediation of issues that may pose long-term structural problems to the banking system and the critical markets it supports, including addressing regulatory disincentives to Treasury market intermediation activities by banks and their affiliates.

As I work toward improvements in bank regulation, together with counterparts at the other agencies, I will continue to rely on a tailored approach, especially for community and regional banks. Tailoring is fundamental to ensuring we maintain and enhance the diversity of the U.S. banking system, which must include and support banks of all sizes.

The U.S. regulatory framework has grown expansively to become overly complicated and redundant, with conflicting and overlapping requirements. This growth has imposed unnecessary and significant costs on banks and their customers.

Third, regulators must promote innovation in the banking system. To remain viable and competitive, banks must be able to consider new technologies that can improve products and services, and lower costs. Regulators should adopt an approach that encourages and promotes sensible innovation.

Finally, to promote accountability, regulators must be transparent—both in supervision and regulation. Successful policymaking requires openness and humility, caution and a deliberate approach. I can assure the Committee that if I am confirmed as the Vice Chair for Supervision, I will be strongly committed to these values.

As I have demonstrated throughout my career, I am committed to carrying out my responsibilities by objectively making decisions based on the best available information and input from community and business leaders, industry, consumer groups, academics and Americans from across the country.

Thank you and I look forward to answering your questions.

For release at 10:00 a.m. EDT

Federal bank regulatory agencies today reported in the 2024 Shared National Credit (SNC) report that credit risk associated with large, syndicated bank loans remains moderate. However, the agencies noted weakened credit quality trends continue due to the pressure of higher interest rates on leveraged borrowers and compressed operating margins in some industry sectors.

The agencies also noted that the magnitude and direction of risk in 2025 is likely to be impacted by borrowers' ability to manage interest expenses, real estate conditions, and other macroeconomic factors.

The 2024 review reflects the examination of SNC loans originated on or before June 30, 2024. The review focused on leveraged loans and stressed borrowers from various industry sectors and assessed aggregate loan commitments of $100 million or more that are shared by multiple regulated financial institutions.

The 2024 SNC portfolio included 6,699 borrowers totaling $6.5 trillion in commitments, an increase in commitments of 1.8 percent from a year ago. The percentage of loans that deserve management's close attention (""non-pass"" loans comprised of SNC commitments rated ""special mention"" and ""classified"") increased from 8.9 percent of total commitments to 9.1 percent year over year. While U.S. banks hold 45 percent of all SNC commitments, they hold only 23 percent of non-pass loans. Nearly half of total SNC commitments are leveraged, and leveraged loans comprise 79 percent of non-pass loans.

Federal Reserve Board begins 2025 Survey of Consumer Finances

For release at 11:00 a.m. EST

The Federal Reserve Board in March will begin its regular study of household finances, the Survey of Consumer Finances, which provides the public and policymakers with detailed and important insights into the economic condition of American families.

""This survey is an important source of information on the financial well-being of American families,"" Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell said in a letter to prospective survey participants. ""Our most recent survey, which took place in 2022, has been important to understanding the different ways that American families experienced the unusual economic conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.""

The data collected will provide a representative picture of what Americans own—from houses and cars to stocks and bonds—how and how much they borrow, and how they bank, as well as their feelings about their economic situation and that of the United States more broadly. Past study results have contributed to policy discussions regarding the evolution of housing as a key component of wealth, the recovery of households from the Great Recession, changes in the kinds and amount of credit used by families, and a broad range of other issues.

The current version of the survey has been undertaken every three years since 1983. It is being conducted through December of this year and for the Board by NORC, a social science research organization at the University of Chicago.

Participants in the study are chosen at random from 119 geographic areas, including metropolitan areas and rural counties across the United States, using a scientific sampling procedure. A representative of NORC contacts each potential participant personally to explain the study and request time for an interview.

Individual survey responses are kept strictly confidential. NORC uses names and addresses only for the administration of the survey and must destroy that identifying information at the close of the study. NORC is forbidden from giving the names and addresses of participants to anyone at the Federal Reserve or elsewhere, and that information is permanently destroyed after the survey is completed.

Summary results for the 2025 study will be published in late 2026 after all data from the survey have been assessed and analyzed. The

letter

from Chair Powell will be mailed in mid-March to approximately 13,000 households urging their participation in the study.

Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress

Chair Jerome H. Powell

Before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.

Watch Live

Chair Powell submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, on February 12, 2025.

Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Warren, and other members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual

Monetary Policy Report

.

The Federal Reserve remains squarely focused on achieving its dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years. Labor market conditions have cooled from their formerly overheated state and remain solid. Inflation has moved much closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal, though it remains somewhat elevated. We are attentive to the risks on both sides of our mandate.

I will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.

Current Economic Situation and Outlook

Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Gross domestic product rose 2.5 percent in 2024, bolstered by resilient consumer spending. Investment in equipment and intangibles appears to have declined in the fourth quarter but was solid for the year overall. Following weakness in the middle of last year, activity in the housing sector seems to have stabilized.

In the labor market, conditions remain solid and appear to have stabilized. Payroll job gains averaged 189,000 per month over the past four months. Following earlier increases, the unemployment rate has been steady since the middle of last year and, at 4 percent in January, remains low. Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are broadly in balance. The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures. The strong labor market conditions in recent years have helped narrow long-standing disparities in employment and earnings across demographic groups.

1

Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December, and, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.

Monetary Policy

Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. Since last September, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the policy rate by a full percentage point from its peak after having maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent for 14 months. That recalibration of our policy stance was appropriate in light of the progress on inflation and the cooling in the labor market. Meanwhile, we have continued to reduce our securities holdings.

With our policy stance now significantly less restrictive than it had been and the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance. We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the FOMC will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.

As the economy evolves, we will adjust our policy stance in a manner that best promotes our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. If the economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can maintain policy restraint for longer. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly. We are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate, and policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face.

This year, we are conducting the second periodic review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications—the framework used to pursue our congressionally assigned goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The focus of this review is on the FOMC's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which articulates the Committee's approach to monetary policy, and on the Committee's policy communications tools. The Committee's 2 percent longer-run inflation goal will be retained and will not be a focus of the review.

Our review will include outreach and public events involving a wide range of parties, including

Fed Listens

events around the country and a research conference in May. We will take on board lessons of the past five years and adapt our approach where appropriate to best serve the American people, to whom we are accountable. We intend to wrap up the review by late summer.

Let me conclude by emphasizing that at the Fed, we will do everything we can to achieve the two goals Congress set for monetary policy—maximum employment and stable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission.

Thank you. I look forward to your questions.

Monetary Policy Report

includes as a special topic an update on employment and earnings across demographic groups.

archive,press (archive),Federal Reserve Board releases the hypothetical scenarios for its annual stress test,https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20250205a.htm,2025-02-05T00:00:00+00:00,press,,"February 05, 2025

Federal Reserve Board releases the hypothetical scenarios for its annual stress test

For release at 4:30 p.m. EST

The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday released the hypothetical scenarios for its annual stress test, which helps ensure that large banks can lend to households and businesses even in a severe recession. Additionally, the Board released two hypothetical elements designed to probe different risks through its ""exploratory analysis"" of the banking system. The exploratory analysis will not affect bank capital requirements.

The Board's annual stress test evaluates the resilience of large banks by estimating losses, net revenue, and capital levels—which provide a cushion against losses—under hypothetical recession scenarios that extend two years into the future. This year, 22 banks will be tested against a severe global recession with heightened stress in both commercial and residential real estate markets, as well as in corporate debt markets. The scenarios are not forecasts and should not be interpreted as predictions of future economic conditions.

In the 2025 stress test scenario, the U.S. unemployment rate rises nearly 5.9 percentage points, to a peak of 10 percent. The unemployment rate increase is accompanied by severe market volatility, a widening of corporate bond spreads, and a collapse in asset prices, including about a 33 percent decline in house prices and a 30 percent decline in commercial real estate prices.

Large banks with substantial trading or custodial operations are also required to incorporate a counterparty default scenario component to estimate potential losses from the unexpected default of the firm's largest counterparty amid an acute market shock. In addition, banks with large trading operations will be tested against a global market shock component that primarily stresses their trading and related positions.

The table below shows the components of the annual stress test that apply to each bank, based on data as of the third quarter of 2024.

This year's exploratory analysis includes two separate hypothetical elements that will assess the resilience of the banking system to a wider range of risks. One of the hypothetical elements examines how banks would react to credit and liquidity shocks in the non-bank financial institution sector during a severe global recession.

The second element of the exploratory analysis includes a market shock that will be applied only to the largest and most complex banks. This shock hypothesizes the failure of five large hedge funds with reduced global economic activity and higher inflation.

The exploratory analysis is distinct from the stress test and will explore additional hypothetical risks to the broader banking system, rather than focusing on firm-specific results. The Board will publish aggregate results for the exploratory analysis alongside the annual stress test results in June 2025.

As the Board previously announced, it plans to take steps soon to reduce the volatility of stress test results and begin to improve model transparency in the 2025 stress test. Additionally, it intends to begin the public comment process on its comprehensive changes to the stress test this year.

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

National Credit Union Administration

California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation

For release at 1:00 p.m. EST

The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, collectively the agencies, recognize the serious impact of the California wildfires and straight-line winds on the customers and operations of many financial institutions and will provide appropriate regulatory assistance to affected institutions subject to their supervision. The agencies encourage institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities.

A complete list of the current disaster areas can be found at

https://www.fema.gov/disaster/declarations

.

Lending:

The agencies encourage financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds. Prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas are supported by the agencies and should not be subject to examiner criticism. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, institutions should individually evaluate modifications of existing loans to determine whether modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty should be accounted for as a new loan or a continuance of an existing loan. In making this evaluation, institutions should consider the facts and circumstances of each borrower and appropriately report the modification in the institution's call report. In supervising institutions affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds, the agencies will consider the unusual circumstances these institutions face. The agencies recognize that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound practices as well as in the public interest.

Temporary Facilities:

The agencies understand that many financial institutions face staffing, power, telecommunications, and other challenges in re-opening facilities after the California wildfires and straight-line winds. In cases in which operational challenges persist, the primary federal or state regulator will expedite, as appropriate, any request to operate temporary facilities to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds. In most cases, a telephone notice to the primary federal or state regulator will suffice initially to start the approval process, with necessary written notification being submitted shortly thereafter.

Publishing Requirements:

The agencies understand that the damage caused by the California wildfires and straight-line winds may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations. Institutions experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact their primary federal or state regulator.

Regulatory Reporting Requirements:

Institutions affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds that expect to encounter difficulty meeting the agencies' reporting requirements should contact their primary federal or state regulator to discuss their situation. The agencies do not expect to assess penalties or take other supervisory action against institutions that take reasonable and prudent steps to comply with the agencies' regulatory reporting requirements if those institutions are unable to fully satisfy those requirements because of the California wildfires and straight-line winds.

The agencies' staffs stand ready to work with affected institutions that may be experiencing problems fulfilling their reporting responsibilities, taking into account each institution's particular circumstances, including the status of its reporting and recordkeeping systems and the condition of its underlying financial records.

Community Reinvestment Act (CRA):

Financial institutions may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas. For additional information, refer to the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment at

https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm

.

Investments:

Institutions are encouraged to monitor municipal securities and loans affected by the California wildfires and straight-line winds. The agencies realize local government projects may be negatively affected by the disaster and encourage institutions to engage in appropriate monitoring and take prudent efforts to stabilize such investments.

The Federal Reserve Board announced on Monday that Michael S. Barr will step down from his position as Federal Reserve Board Vice Chair for Supervision, effective February 28, 2025, or such earlier time as a successor is confirmed. Barr will continue to serve as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.

Barr, who has served as vice chair for supervision since July 19, 2022, submitted his letter of resignation to President Joseph R. Biden.

""It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as the Federal Reserve Board's vice chair for supervision, and to work with colleagues to help maintain the stability and strength of the U.S. financial system so that it can meet the needs of American families and businesses,"" Vice Chair for Supervision Barr said. ""The position of vice chair for supervision was created after the Global Financial Crisis to create greater responsibility, transparency, and accountability for the Federal Reserve's supervision and regulation of the financial system. The risk of a dispute over the position could be a distraction from our mission. In the current environment, I've determined that I would be more effective in serving the American people from my role as governor.""

The Board does not intend to take up any major rulemakings until a vice chair for supervision successor is confirmed.

As vice chair for supervision, Barr oversaw the supervision and regulation of financial firms in the Board's jurisdiction and collaborated with other bank regulators to ensure the banking system remained a source of strength, despite stresses in early 2023.

Prior to his appointment, Barr held multiple positions at the University of Michigan through several decades, including serving as the Dean of the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, and as a professor of law, where he taught financial regulation and international finance. He served in the U.S. Department of the Treasury several times in senior policy roles and earlier clerked for Justice David H. Souter on the U.S. Supreme Court. He graduated from Yale University, Oxford University, and Yale Law School.

A copy of his letter resigning from the position of vice chair for supervision is attached.

Due to evolving legal landscape & changes in the framework of administrative law, Federal Reserve Board will soon seek public comment on significant changes to improve transparency of bank stress tests & reduce volatility of resulting capital requirements

For release at 4:00 p.m. EST

In view of the evolving legal landscape, the Federal Reserve Board will soon seek public comment on significant changes to improve the transparency of its bank stress tests and to reduce the volatility of resulting capital buffer requirements.

The Board's stress test evaluates the resilience of large banks by estimating their losses, revenue, and capital levels under a hypothetical recession scenario that changes each year. Capital acts as a cushion to absorb losses and allows banks to continue lending to households and businesses even during a recession. Since its inception over 15 years ago, large banks in the stress test have more than doubled their capital levels, an increase of more than $1 trillion.

The Board intends to propose changes that include, but are not limited to: disclosing and seeking public comment on all of the models that determine the hypothetical losses and revenue of banks under stress; averaging results over two years to reduce the year-over-year changes in the capital requirements that result from the stress test; and ensuring that the public can comment on the hypothetical scenarios used annually for the test, before the scenarios are finalized. These proposed changes are not designed to materially affect overall capital requirements.

The framework of administrative law has changed significantly in recent years. The Board analyzed the current stress test in view of the evolving legal landscape and determined to modify the test in important respects to improve its resiliency.

The Board will continue its exploratory analysis, which assesses additional risks to the banking system in ways that are separate from the stress test. The analysis would be used to inform bank supervision and financial stability assessments. It will continue to be disclosed in aggregate and not affect bank capital requirements.

For the 2025 stress test, the Board plans to take immediate steps to reduce the volatility of the results and begin to improve model transparency. The Board intends to begin the public comment process on its comprehensive changes to the stress test during the early part of 2025.

Agencies release annual asset-size thresholds under Community Reinvestment Act regulations

Federal Reserve Board

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

For release at 3:30 p.m. EST

The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation today announced the 2025 updated Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) ""small bank"" and ""intermediate small bank"" asset-size thresholds.

The CRA regulations establish the framework and criteria by which the relevant agencies assess a financial institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. Financial institutions are evaluated under different CRA examination procedures based upon their asset-size classification. The asset-size thresholds are adjusted annually based on the average change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), which is a measure of inflation.

As a result of the 2.91 percent increase in the CPI-W for the period ending in November 2024, the CRA asset-size thresholds for small banks and intermediate small banks are:

A small bank is an institution that, as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar years, had assets of less than $1.609 billion.

An intermediate small bank is a small institution with assets of at least $402 million as of December 31 of both of the prior two calendar years and less than $1.609 billion as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar years.

These thresholds are in effect from January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025. A list of the current and historical asset-size thresholds is available

For release at 11:00 a.m. EST

Five federal financial regulatory agencies, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and state financial regulators issued a statement today to provide supervised institutions with examples of risk management and other practices that may be effective in combatting elder financial exploitation.

Older adults who experience financial exploitation can lose their life savings and financial security and face other harm. A FinCEN financial trend analysis of Bank Secrecy Act reports over a one-year period ending in June 2023 found that about $27 billion in reported suspicious activity was linked to elder financial exploitation.

Banks, credit unions, and other supervised institutions play an important role in combatting elder financial exploitation and supporting their customers who experience these crimes. The statement provides examples of risk management and other practices that supervised institutions may use to help identify, prevent, and respond to elder financial exploitation, including but not limited to:

Developing effective governance and oversight, including policies and practices to protect account holders and the institution

Training employees on recognizing and responding to elder financial exploitation

Using transaction holds and disbursement delays, as appropriate, and consistent with applicable law

Establishing a trusted contact designation process for account holders

Filing suspicious activity reports to FinCEN in a timely manner

Reporting suspected elder financial exploitation to law enforcement, Adult Protective Services, and other appropriate entities

Providing financial records to appropriate authorities where consistent with applicable law

Engaging with elder fraud prevention and response networks

The federal bank regulatory agencies today announced their third notice requesting comment to reduce regulatory burden. The Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 requires the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council and federal bank regulatory agencies to review their regulations at least once every 10 years to identify outdated or otherwise unnecessary regulatory requirements for their supervised institutions.

To facilitate this review, the agencies divided their regulations into 12 categories and are now soliciting comments on their regulations for three categories: Rules of Procedure, Safety and Soundness, and Securities. The public has 90 days from publication in the

Federal Register

to comment on the relevant regulations.

The agencies will request comment on regulations in the remaining categories in 2025, asking the public to identify the regulations they believe are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome.

The agencies will hold a series of outreach meetings where interested parties may comment on applicable regulatory requirements directly to the agencies. Information about the outreach meetings will be publicized as details are finalized.

Federal Reserve announces College Fed Challenge winners

For release at 2:00 p.m. EST

Princeton University won the 21st annual national

College Fed Challenge

on Friday, a team competition that encourages undergraduate students to learn about the U.S. economy, monetary policymaking, and the role of the Federal Reserve System. Teams analyze economic and financial conditions and formulate a monetary policy recommendation, modeling the Federal Open Market Committee. The team, from Princeton, New Jersey, represented the Philadelphia District and included Bracklinn Williams, Daniel Sozanski, Eleanor Clemans-Cope, Elliot Lee, William Neumann, Bijaan Noormohamed (alternate), and Manuel Garcia San Millan (alternate). The team's advisers were Alan Blinder, Carolyn Wilkins, and William Dudley.

This year's College Fed Challenge included

119 schools

from across the nation. Each submitted video presentations or participated in local competitions last month. Eighteen semi-finalist teams then participated in question-and-answer sessions held earlier this month, and six finalists were selected to determine the winners. The other national finalists were Harvard College in second place and University of Virginia in third place. Teams with honorable mentions include University of Michigan, Pace University, and University of Miami.

""Fed Challenge gives undergraduate students a chance to learn about the Fed and monetary policy,"" said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell. ""Fed policymakers carefully consider incoming economic data and work together to determine the best policy to pursue our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. Through the Fed Challenge experience, students go through similar deliberations and gain a better understanding of the economy and the Fed's role in it.""

Teams were evaluated on their economic analysis, responses to the judges' questions, teamwork, and presentations. The judges for the final round were Lisheng Su, lead risk management specialist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago; Brian Doyle, deputy director of the Board's Division of International Finance; and Robert Tetlow, a senior adviser in the Board's Division of Monetary Affairs.

For release at 1:30 p.m. EST

The Federal Reserve on Friday announced additional information about the periodic review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications—the framework it uses to pursue its congressionally-assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability.

The review is focused on two specific areas: the Federal Open Market Committee's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which articulates the Committee's approach to monetary policy; and the Committee's policy communications tools. The Committee's two percent longer-run inflation goal will not be a focus of the review.

""We are open to new ideas and critical feedback and will take onboard lessons from the last five years and adapt our approach where appropriate to best serve the American people, to whom we are accountable,"" said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell.

Like the review that concluded in 2020, the upcoming review will include outreach and public events with a wide range of parties. As part of the outreach effort, the Federal Reserve Board will host a research conference on May 15-16, 2025, with speakers and panelists from outside the Federal Reserve System.

The Federal Reserve will continue to host

Fed Listens

public events around the country, and discussions among Federal Reserve policymakers will begin with the January 28-29, 2025, FOMC meeting.

At the end of the process, policymakers will assess the information and perspectives gathered during the review and report their findings. The Fed's first review began in 2019 and concluded in summer 2020.

The Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced pricing, effective January 1, 2025, for payment services the Federal Reserve Banks provide to banks and credit unions, such as the clearing of checks, automated clearing house (ACH) transactions, instant payments, and wholesale payment and settlement services.

By law, the Federal Reserve must establish fees to recover the costs, including imputed costs, of providing payment services over the long run. The Federal Reserve expects to recover 104.1 percent of actual and imputed expenses in 2025, including the return on equity that would have been earned if a private-sector firm provided the services. Overall, the Reserve Banks estimate that the price changes for 2025 will result in a 2.8 percent average price increase for established, mature services.

Along with the pricing information, the Board also released transaction volume and value data for FedNow, the Federal Reserve's 24x7x365 instant payments service. The data show that adoption continues to grow, with modest volumes that are in line with the introduction of a new payments service.

The entire 2025 fee schedule is included in the

Supervision and Regulation

Vice Chair for Supervision Michael S. Barr

Before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.

Watch Live

Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Waters, and other members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on the Federal Reserve's supervisory and regulatory activities. Accompanying my testimony is the Federal Reserve's semiannual

Supervision and Regulation Report

. Today, I will discuss current conditions in the banking sector, and our recent supervisory and regulatory activities.

Banking Conditions

Overall, the banking system remains sound and resilient. Banks continue to report capital and liquidity ratios above minimum regulatory levels, and asset quality generally remains sound. Bank lending has continued to grow, albeit at a modest pace that reflects decreased demand and tighter lending standards than we have seen since early last year.

Capital ratios have increased this year, building on the capital increases from the year before and leaving the system better positioned to weather potential losses. This is supported by this year's stress test results, which showed that large banks have sufficient capital to meet their minimum capital ratios and continue their operations under a highly stressful scenario.

Liquidity conditions overall are stable. Notably, deposits and liquid assets on bank balance sheets remained steady in the first half of the year. Additionally, the share of uninsured deposits in the system continued to decline, falling to a level last seen in 2019.

While the system as a whole is resilient, we are carefully monitoring the continued rise in delinquency rates among certain commercial real estate loans—such as those backed by offices, especially in major cities, and, more recently, those backed by multifamily housing. Delinquency rates for certain consumer loans are also elevated. In response to rising delinquencies, banks have increased loan loss provisions. Cybersecurity risk also continues to be a supervisory priority. The Federal Reserve's supervisory activities in this area promote financial institutions' ability to protect against cyber incidents, safeguard critical infrastructure, and address emerging technology risks.

Supervision

Federal Reserve supervisors continue to work diligently to assess all bank risk-management practices to be prepared for both expected and unexpected stresses.

We continue to make progress on improving the speed, force, and agility of supervision to align better with the risks, size, and complexity of supervised banks, as appropriate. This is necessary to ensure that banks and supervisors are managing the types of risks highlighted by last year's stress in the banking system. Supervisors must be prepared to take timely action as risks build up; deploy supervisory tools and escalation effectively; account for changes in market, economic, and financial conditions in their examination priorities and supervisory conclusions; and identify new and different patterns of risks.

We have made progress on these goals. First, we are working to ensure that supervision intensifies at the right pace as a bank grows in size and complexity. Second, we are modifying supervisory processes so that once issues are identified, they are addressed more quickly by both banks and supervisors. Third, we are finding ways to better incorporate forward-looking risk analysis into supervision.

Regulation

Moving to regulation, as you know, last summer, the Board sought comment on two proposed rules that would modify risk-based capital requirements for large banks: the Basel III Endgame proposal and the proposal to adjust the capital surcharge for the largest and most complex banks. We asked for and received a great number of comments on all aspects of the proposals and, earlier this year, I laid out potential adjustments to these proposals based on those comments.

Last year, the bank regulatory agencies also invited comment on a proposal to require large banks to issue and maintain a minimum amount of long-term debt. We received feedback from commenters on potential adjustments to the proposal, which are under consideration. And, as I have mentioned in previous speeches, we have been considering ways to improve liquidity resilience and improve banks' ability to respond to funding shocks.

These initiatives have been joint efforts among the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC, and we look forward to that continued collaboration next year. We will continue to seek an approach that helps to ensure financial system resilience and supports the flow of credit to households and businesses through the economic cycle.

Thank you. I am happy to take your questions.

Federal and state financial regulatory agencies issue interagency statement on supervisory practices regarding financial institutions affected by Hurricane Milton

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

National Credit Union Administration

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

For release at 2:30 p.m. EDT

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, collectively the agencies, recognize the serious impact of Hurricane Milton on the customers and operations of many financial institutions and will provide appropriate regulatory assistance to affected institutions subject to their supervision. The agencies encourage institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities.

A complete list of the current disaster areas can be found at

https://www.fema.gov/disaster/declarations

.

Lending:

The agencies encourage

financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by Hurricane Milton. Prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas are supported by the agencies and should not be subject to examiner criticism. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, institutions should individually evaluate modifications of existing loans to determine whether they represent troubled debt restructurings or modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, as applicable. In making this evaluation, institutions should consider the facts and circumstances of each borrower and modification. In supervising institutions affected by Hurricane Milton, the agencies will consider the unusual circumstances these institutions face. The agencies recognize that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound practices as well as in the public interest.

Temporary Facilities:

The agencies understand that many financial institutions face staffing, power, telecommunications, and other challenges in re-opening facilities after Hurricane Milton. In cases in which operational challenges persist, the primary federal and/or state regulator will expedite, as appropriate, any request to operate temporary facilities to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by Hurricane Milton. In most cases, a telephone notice to the primary federal and/or state regulator will suffice initially to start the approval process, with necessary written notification being submitted shortly thereafter.

Publishing Requirements:

The agencies understand that the damage caused by Hurricane Milton may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations. Institutions experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator.

Regulatory Reporting Requirements:

Institutions affected by Hurricane Milton that expect to encounter difficulty meeting the agencies' reporting requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator to discuss their situation. The agencies do not expect to assess penalties or take other supervisory action against institutions that take reasonable and prudent steps to comply with the agencies' regulatory reporting requirements if those institutions are unable to fully satisfy those requirements because of Hurricane Milton.

The agencies' staffs stand ready to work with affected institutions that may be experiencing problems fulfilling their reporting responsibilities, taking into account each institution's particular circumstances, including the status of its reporting and recordkeeping systems and the condition of its underlying financial records.

Community Reinvestment Act (CRA):

Financial institutions may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas. For additional information, refer to the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment at

https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm

.

Investments:

Institutions are encouraged to monitor municipal securities and loans affected by Hurricane Milton. The agencies realize local government projects may be negatively affected by the disaster and encourage institutions to engage in appropriate monitoring and take prudent efforts to stabilize such investments.

Federal Reserve Board fines Toronto-Dominion Bank $123.5 million for violations related to anti-money laundering laws

For release at 1:00 p.m. EDT

The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday fined Toronto-Dominion Bank $123.5 million for violations related to anti-money laundering laws. The Board is also requiring TD to implement enhanced measures to comply with anti-money laundering laws and to correct its risk management deficiencies.

TD failed to conduct adequate risk management and oversight of its retail banking operations in the United States, resulting in a U.S. subsidiary being used to launder hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit proceeds. The Board's action will help ensure that TD operates in compliance with all U.S. laws and regulations.

The Board is requiring TD to:

Establish a new office in the United States dedicated to remediating the deficiencies identified in the order;

Relocate to the United States the parts of its anti-money laundering compliance program that are responsible for complying with U.S. law. This program will be subject to oversight by U.S. regulators;

Certify that sufficient resources and attention are allocated to correcting the firm's anti-money laundering deficiencies prior to issuing any dividends or capital distributions; and

Undertake a thorough and independent review of the firm's board of directors and management to ensure adequate oversight of the U.S. operations.

Canada's Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the home country supervisor of TD, can act in the implementation of these requirements as permitted by its legal authority.

This action is being taken in conjunction with criminal and regulatory actions that are being taken by the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey, the Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The penalties announced by the agencies total approximately $3.09 billion. The bank is also pleading guilty to criminal charges brought by law enforcement authorities.

For release at 11:30 a.m. EDT

The Federal Reserve Board and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau today announced the dollar thresholds used to determine whether certain consumer credit and lease transactions in 2025 are subject to certain protections under Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) and Regulation M (Consumer Leasing).

By law, the agencies are required to adjust the thresholds annually based on the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, known as CPI-W. Transactions at or below the thresholds are subject to the protections of the regulations.

Specifically, based on the 3.4 percent annual percentage increase in the CPI-W as of June 1, 2024, Regulation Z and Regulation M generally will apply to consumer credit transactions and consumer leases of $71,900 or less in 2025. However, private education loans and loans secured by real property, such as mortgages, are subject to Regulation Z regardless of the amount of the loan.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Reserve Board, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency today announced that the 2025 threshold for higher-priced mortgage loans that are subject to special appraisal requirements will increase from $32,400 to $33,500.

The threshold amount will be effective January 1, 2025, and is based on the 3.4 percent annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, known as CPI-W, as of June 1, 2024.

The Dodd-Frank Act added special appraisal requirements for higher-priced mortgage loans to the Truth in Lending Act, including that creditors obtain a written appraisal based on a physical visit to the interior of the home before making a higher-priced mortgage loan. The rules implementing these requirements contain an exemption for loans of $25,000 or less, adjusted annually to reflect CPI-W increases.

Federal Reserve Board requests comment around operational practices of the discount window

For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT

The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday requested public input around the operational practices of the discount window, which provides short-term credit for banks and credit unions. Feedback gathered through this process will be used by the Board and the Reserve Banks, which administer the discount window, to further improve the efficiency and ease of access to discount window and intraday credit.

The discount window is an effective tool that plays an important role in supporting the liquidity and stability of the banking system. By providing ready access to funding against a wide range of collateral, it supports the smooth flow of credit to households and businesses. The Reserve Banks also provide intraday credit to eligible institutions, which supports the safety and soundness of the payments system. While the discount window continues to operate effectively, the Board and Reserve Banks seek to be proactive to ensure that it remains effective and efficient as the banking system continues to evolve.

Specifically, the request for information seeks input on Federal Reserve operational practices, including: the collection of legal documentation; the process for pledging and withdrawing collateral; the process for requesting, receiving, and repaying discount window loans; the extension of intraday credit; and Reserve Bank communication practices related to the discount window and intraday credit.

The comment period will close 90 days after the request for information is published in the

Federal Register

Federal Reserve Board announces final individual capital requirements for all large banks, effective on October 1

For release at 5:00 p.m. EDT

Following its stress test earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday announced final individual capital requirements for all large banks, effective on October 1.

Large bank capital requirements are informed by the Board's stress test results, which provide a risk-sensitive and forward-looking assessment of capital needs. The table shows each bank's common equity tier 1 capital requirement, which is made up of several components, including:

The minimum capital requirement, which is the same for each bank and is 4.5 percent;

The stress capital buffer requirement, which is based in part on the stress test results and is at least 2.5 percent; and

If applicable, a capital surcharge for the largest and most complex banks, which is updated in the first quarter of each year to account for the overall systemic risk of each of these banks.

If a bank's capital dips below its total requirement announced today, the bank is subject to automatic restrictions on both capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.

Also today, the Board announced that it had modified the stress capital buffer requirement for Goldman Sachs, after the firm's request for reconsideration. Based on an analysis of additional information presented by the firm in its request, the Board determined it would be appropriate to adjust the treatment of particular historical expenses incurred by the bank in the stress testing models' input data, due to the non-recurring nature of those expenses. As a result, the bank's stress capital buffer requirement has been adjusted to 6.2 percent from a preliminary 6.4 percent.

The Board is focused on continuously improving the stress testing framework. To that end, the Board will analyze whether to revise regulatory reporting forms to better capture these types of data and to explore possible refinements to certain model components.

Federal Reserve Board issues final joint guidance to help certain large banks further develop their resolution plans

For release at 4:30 p.m. EDT

The Federal Reserve Board on Monday issued final joint guidance to help certain large banks further develop their resolution plans. The final guidance is largely similar to the

proposed guidance

from August 2023 and incorporates changes in response to comments received. The Board developed the guidance jointly with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and it is now final following both agencies' approval.

These resolution plans, also known as living wills, describe a bank's strategy for orderly resolution under bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure.

The guidance generally applies to domestic and foreign banks with more than $250 billion in total assets but that are not the largest and most complex banks, for which guidance is already in place. The guidance addresses the specific characteristics of, and risks posed by, this group of banks.

The guidance is organized around key areas of potential vulnerability, such as capital, liquidity, and operational capabilities that could be needed in resolution. Distinct from the guidance to the largest and most complex banks, this guidance provides agency expectations for both single point of entry and multiple point of entry resolution strategies, which are different strategies banks have adopted for their rapid and orderly resolution. It also recognizes that the preferred resolution outcome for foreign banks is often a successful home country-led resolution and guides foreign banks on how to address the global resolution plan in their U.S. plan.

The agencies also announced that they are extending the resolution plan submission deadline for the banks to which the guidance applies. Banks will be required to submit their resolution plans by October 1, 2025, instead of March 31, 2025. The purpose of the extension is to provide reasonable time for banks to consider the final guidance as they develop their plan submissions.

The federal bank regulatory agencies today issued a statement reminding banks of potential risks associated with third-party arrangements to deliver bank deposit products and services.

The agencies support responsible innovation and banks engaging in these arrangements in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable law. While these arrangements can provide benefits, supervisory experience has identified a range of safety and soundness, compliance, and consumer-related concerns with the management of these arrangements. The statement details the potential risks and provides examples of effective risk management practices for these arrangements. In addition, the statement reminds banks of relevant existing legal requirements, guidance, and related resources, and provides insights that the agencies have gained through their supervision. The statement does not establish new supervisory expectations.

Separately, the agencies have requested additional information on a broad range of bank-fintech arrangements, including with respect to deposit, payments, and lending products and services. The agencies are seeking input on the nature and implications of bank-fintech arrangements and effective risk management practices.

The agencies are considering whether additional steps could help ensure banks effectively manage risks associated with these various types of arrangements.

The federal bank regulatory agencies today announced their second notice requesting comment to reduce regulatory burden. The Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 requires the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council and federal bank regulatory agencies to review their regulations every 10 years to identify outdated or otherwise unnecessary regulatory requirements for their supervised institutions.

To facilitate this review, the agencies divided their regulations into 12 categories and are now soliciting comments on their regulations in three categories: Consumer Protection; Directors, Officers, and Employees; and Money Laundering. The public has 90 days from publication in the

Federal Register

to comment on the relevant regulations.

Over the next two years, the agencies will request comment on regulations in the remaining categories, asking the public to identify the regulations they believe are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome.

The agencies will hold a series of outreach meetings where interested parties may comment on applicable regulatory requirements directly to the agencies. Information about the outreach meetings will be publicized as details are finalized.

For release at 2:30 p.m. EDT

Four federal financial institution regulatory agencies today requested comment on a proposal to update their requirements for supervised institutions to establish, implement, and maintain effective, risk-based, and reasonably designed anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) programs. The amendments are intended to align with changes concurrently proposed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), most of which result from the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AML Act).

The proposed amendments would require supervised institutions to identify, evaluate, and document the regulated institution's money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit finance activity risks, as well as consider, as appropriate, FinCEN's published national AML/CFT priorities. Additionally, and consistent with the AML Act, the proposal would mandate that the duty to establish, maintain, and enforce the AML/CFT program remain the responsibility of, and be performed by, persons in the United States who are accessible to, and subject to the oversight and supervision by, the relevant agency. The proposal also supports institutions' consideration of innovative approaches to meet compliance obligations.

Comments on the proposal are due 60 days after the date of publication in the

Federal Reserve Board takes action to address consumer compliance breakdowns by Green Dot, fining the firm $44 million for numerous unfair and deceptive practices and a deficient consumer compliance risk management program

For release at 1:30 p.m. EDT

The Federal Reserve Board on Friday took action to address consumer compliance breakdowns by Green Dot, fining the firm $44 million for numerous unfair and deceptive practices and a deficient consumer compliance risk management program.

Green Dot violated consumer law in its marketing, selling, and servicing of prepaid debit card products, and its offering of tax return preparation payment services. For example, Green Dot failed to adequately disclose the tax refund processing fee for tax preparation services offered on a third party's website. The firm also blocked access to accounts of legitimate customers receiving unemployment benefits and lacked reasonable policies and procedures to help those customers cure those blocks. In addition, Green Dot did not maintain effective consumer compliance risk management and anti-money laundering programs.

The Board is requiring the firm to take several steps to improve these programs. Green Dot must hire an independent third-party to strengthen its consumer compliance risk management program and address the root causes of consumer complaints. The firm also must develop an effective anti-money laundering program and hire an independent third-party to conduct a review of certain transaction activities.

Agencies finalize interagency guidance on reconsiderations of value for residential real estate valuations

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

Federal Reserve Board

National Credit Union Administration

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

For release at 3:00 p.m. EDT

Five federal regulatory agencies today issued final guidance addressing reconsiderations of value (ROVs) for residential real estate transactions. The guidance advises on policies and procedures that financial institutions may implement to allow consumers to provide financial institutions with information that may not have been considered during an appraisal or if deficiencies are identified in the original appraisal.

ROVs are requests from a financial institution to an appraiser or other preparer of a valuation report to reassess the value of residential real estate. Deficiencies identified in valuations, either through an institution's valuation review processes or through consumer-provided information, may be a basis for financial institutions to question the credibility of the appraisal or valuation report.

The guidance offers examples of ROV policies and procedures that a financial institution may implement to help institutions identify, address, and mitigate discrimination risk; describes the risks of deficient residential real estate valuations; and explains how financial institutions may incorporate ROV processes into risk management functions. The agencies finalized the guidance largely as proposed, with the addition of clarifying edits based on public comments received on the proposed guidance published in July 2023.

Agencies issue final rule to help ensure credibility and integrity of automated valuation models

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

Federal Reserve Board

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

For release at 11:00 a.m. EDT

Six federal regulatory agencies today issued a final rule, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, designed to help ensure the credibility and integrity of models used in valuations for certain mortgages secured by a consumer's principal dwelling. In particular, the rule will implement quality control standards for automated valuation models (AVMs) used by mortgage originators and secondary market issuers in valuing those homes. The final rule is substantially similar to the

proposal

issued in June 2023.

Under the final rule, the agencies will require institutions that engage in certain transactions secured by a consumer's principal dwelling to adopt policies, practices, procedures, and control systems designed to:

ensure a high level of confidence in estimates;

protect against data manipulation;

seek to avoid conflicts of interest;

require random sample testing and reviews; and

comply with nondiscrimination laws.

Driven in part by advances in database and modeling technology and the availability of larger property datasets, AVMs are being used with increasing frequency as part of the real estate valuation process. While advances in AVM technology and data availability have the potential to reduce costs and turnaround times of the property valuation process, it is important that institutions using AVMs take appropriate steps to ensure the credibility and integrity of the valuations produced. It is also important that the AVMs institutions use adhere to quality control standards designed to comply with applicable nondiscrimination laws.

The final rule will become effective on the first day of the calendar quarter following 12 months after publication in the

Federal Register

For release at 10:00 a.m. EDT

Federal bank regulatory agencies today released the 2024 list of distressed or underserved nonmetropolitan middle-income geographies where certain bank activities are eligible for Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) credit.

Under the CRA, the agencies assess a bank's record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. The list released by the agencies includes distressed or underserved nonmetropolitan middle-income geographies where revitalization or stabilization activities are eligible to receive CRA consideration. The designations reflect local economic conditions, including unemployment, poverty, and population changes. Previous years' lists and criteria for designating these areas are available

here

.

Revitalization or stabilization activities in these geographies are eligible to receive CRA consideration under the community development definition for 12 months after publication of the current list. As with past lists, the agencies apply a one-year lag period for geographies that were included in 2023 but are no longer designated as distressed or underserved in the current list.

Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress

Chair Jerome H. Powell

Before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.

Watch Live

Chair Powell submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, on July 10, 2024.

Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Scott, and other members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual

Monetary Policy Report

.

The Federal Reserve remains squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. Over the past two years, the economy has made considerable progress toward the Federal Reserve's 2 percent inflation goal, and labor market conditions have cooled while remaining strong. Reflecting these developments, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are coming into better balance.

I will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.

Current Economic Situation and Outlook

Recent indicators suggest that the U.S. economy continues to expand at a solid pace. Gross domestic product growth appears to have moderated in the first half of this year following impressive strength in the second half of last year. Private domestic demand remains robust, however, with slower but still-solid increases in consumer spending. We have also seen moderate growth in capital spending and a pickup in residential investment so far this year. Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.

In the labor market, a broad set of indicators suggests that conditions have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic: strong, but not overheated. The unemployment rate has moved higher but was still at a low level of 4.1 percent in June. Payroll job gains averaged 222,000 jobs per month in the first half of the year. Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in labor force participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 and a strong pace of immigration. As a result, the jobs-to-workers gap is well down from its peak and now stands just a bit above its 2019 level. Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year. The strong labor market has helped narrow long-standing disparities in employment and earnings across demographic groups.

1

Inflation has eased notably over the past couple of years but remains above the Committee's longer-run goal of 2 percent. Total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in May. Core PCE prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, also increased 2.6 percent. After a lack of progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective in the early part of this year, the most recent monthly readings have shown modest further progress. Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.

Monetary Policy

Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. In support of these goals, the Committee has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent since last July, after having tightened the stance of monetary policy significantly over the previous year and a half. We have also continued to reduce our securities holdings. At our May meeting, we decided to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff starting in June, consistent with the plans released previously. Our restrictive monetary policy stance is helping to bring demand and supply conditions into better balance and to put downward pressure on inflation.

The Committee has stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. Incoming data for the first quarter of this year did not support such greater confidence. The most recent inflation readings, however, have shown some modest further progress, and more good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.

We continue to make decisions meeting by meeting. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could stall or even reverse the progress we have seen on inflation. At the same time, in light of the progress made both in lowering inflation and in cooling the labor market over the past two years, elevated inflation is not the only risk we face. Reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will continue its practice of carefully assessing incoming data and their implications for the evolving outlook, the balance of risks, and the appropriate path of monetary policy.

Congress has entrusted the Federal Reserve with the operational independence that is needed to take a longer-term perspective in the pursuit of our dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the long run. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.

Let me conclude by emphasizing that we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission.

Thank you. I am happy to take your questions.
